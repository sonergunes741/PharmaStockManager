# PharmaStockManager
## Initial Commit and Future Development

The initial commit of this project was made to set up the core architecture, project structure, and initial configurations. The goal was to establish a solid foundation upon which the team can collaboratively develop and enhance the system.

- **Project Structure**: Created core directories and files for a smooth start.
- **Core Architecture**: Defined the main structure for scalability.
- **Dependencies**: Integrated essential frameworks like ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server.
- **Authentication & Database**: Basic authentication and database schema set up.
  
From now on, **all future development will occur on new branches**, and contributions will follow standard collaboration practices. This commit was made solely to ensure that the projectâ€™s structure and base were well-defined.

This marks the beginning of collaborative development for the Pharmaceutical Stock Management System.
