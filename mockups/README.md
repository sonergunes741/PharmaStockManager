# Frontend Prototypes

This folder contains the user interface prototypes designed for the project. These prototypes serve as a guide for the final design process and help establish a shared visual language among team members.

Each prototype reflects ideas aimed at enhancing user experience and visual consistency. The structure and style examples provided here will be referenced during the frontend development phase of the project.
